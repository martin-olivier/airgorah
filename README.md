`Airgorah` can be used to audit a WiFi network by discovering the clients connected to it, performing deauth attacks against specific clients or all the clients connected to the network, or by cracking the password of the access point.

It is written in Rust and uses [GTK4 bindings](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs) for the graphical part. The software is based on [aircrack-ng](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng) tools suite.

## Legal

⚠️ Airgorah is designed to be used in testing and discovering flaws in networks you are owner of. Performing attacks on WiFi networks you are not owner of is illegal in almost all countries. I am not responsible for whatever damage you may cause by using this software.

## Requirements

This software only works on `linux` and requires `root` privileges to run.

You will also need a wireless network card that supports `monitor mode` and `packet injection`.

## Installation

You can find pre-built releases for `Debian` based distributions [here](https://github.com/martin-olivier/airgorah/releases/latest) (Ubuntu, PopOS, Mint, Kali). You will just need to download the debian package and install it with the following command:

```
wget https://github.com/martin-olivier/airgorah/releases/download/v0.2.0/airgorah_0.2.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ./airgorah_0.2.0_amd64.deb
```

Otherwise, if you'd like to compile from source, you can follow this [guide](docs/build_from_source.md).
